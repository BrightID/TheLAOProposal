#LAO BrightID Proposal Actions

#Whitelist Subs tokens
At the initial launch of The LAO, BrightID subscriptions (“subs”) tokens ([etherscan address](https://etherscan.io/token/0x61CEAc48136d6782DBD83c09f51E23514D12470a)) will be whitelisted.

In order to comply with the “token whitelisting” section in the article on LAO smart contracts, BrightID Main DAO has renounced its pauser role from the subscriptions token as can be seen from the smart contract’s event logs
